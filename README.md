1.House Price Prediction 

The House Price Prediction project uses machine learning techniques to predict the sale prices of residential houses based on various features such as location, size, quality, and condition. This project is built using Python, with key libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.

The dataset typically includes information such as:

Lot area and year built

Number of rooms (bedroom, kitchen, etc.)

Overall condition and quality

Neighborhood

External and internal materials

2.Project Workflow:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding (e.g., ordinal encoding for ExterQual)

Feature scaling and normalization

Log transformation to normalize skewed distributions

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation matrix, histograms, boxplots to identify important features

Outlier detection and feature selection

3.Modeling:

Models used: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, SVR

Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation

Evaluation metrics: RMSE, RÂ² score

Prediction & Submission

Final prediction on test data

Exporting results to .csv format for Kaggle or internal submission

4. Goal:
The aim is to build a robust and accurate regression model that can generalize well to unseen data and provide reliable price predictions for houses.
